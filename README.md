dump_garmin_connect
===================

What?
-----

Script that creates local back-ups of a Garmin Connect users activity files in
GPX, TCX and KLM format.

Does not overwrite existing files by default.

Tested in Windows and Linux.

Why?
----

The Garmin Connect website currently only supports exporting activities one at
a time.

Any known issues?
-----------------

No. But it hasn't been tested with large numbers of activities. GC quite
possibly does paging that will confuse the script.

License?
--------

BSD. See source.
